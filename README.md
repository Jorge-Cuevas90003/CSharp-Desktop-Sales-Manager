## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

*   [Visual Studio 2019 or later](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)
*   [MySQL Server](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/) (e.g., via XAMPP, WAMP, or standalone)
*   [MySQL Connector/NET](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/net/)
*   [SAP Crystal Reports for Visual Studio](https://www.sap.com/products/crystal-reports/trial.html) (Developer Edition for VS and the Runtime)

### Installation Steps

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Jorge-Cuevas90003/CSharp-Desktop-Sales-Manager.git
    cd CSharp-Desktop-Sales-Manager
    ```

2.  **Set up the database:**
    *   Using a tool like phpMyAdmin or MySQL Workbench, create a new database named `prueba1`.
    *   Import the `database/schema.sql` file to create all the necessary tables and populate them with sample data.

3.  **Configure the connection string:**
    *   Open `app.config` and update the `connectionString` with your MySQL password:
        ```xml
        <add name="MiConexion"
             connectionString="datasource=localhost;port=3306;username=yours;password=yours;database=prueba1"
             providerName="MySql.Data.MySqlClient"/>
        ```

4.  **Run the application:**
    *   Open the `prueba1.sln` file in Visual Studio.
    *   Visual Studio should automatically restore the NuGet packages. If not, right-click the solution and select "Restore NuGet Packages".
    *   Press `F5` or click "Start" to build and run the project.

## üí° Code Reflection & Future Improvements

As an early project in my development journey, this application was a fantastic learning experience. If I were to rebuild it today, I would make several improvements based on modern best practices:

*   **Security First:** The current implementation constructs SQL queries using string concatenation, which is highly vulnerable to **SQL Injection**.
    > **Actionable Improvement:** Refactor all database calls to use **parameterized queries** (e.g., `MySqlCommand.Parameters.AddWithValue`) to completely mitigate this critical security risk.


*   **Modern UI/UX:** Windows Forms is a classic framework, but modern applications often use more flexible UI technologies.
    > **Actionable Improvement:** Rebuild the UI using a more modern framework like WPF, .NET MAUI for cross-platform support, or even as a web application using ASP.NET Core.
